#### Model `claude-3-5-haiku-20241022 (latest)`

Example user prompt:

```text
We have niesamowitą pogodę today!
```

Model response:

```text
<thinking>
I will analyze the message for language:
- "We have" is in English
- "niesamowitą" is a Polish word meaning "amazing"
- "pogodę" is a Polish word meaning "weather"
- "today" is in English
- The message contains a mix of English and Polish words, so it is not entirely in English
